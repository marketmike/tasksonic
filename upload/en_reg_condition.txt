E-MAIL ADDRESSES

Members agree not to post their e-mail address on the site, except in the \"e-mail\" field of the signup form, or when asked by Task Sonic at any other time. There should be no need to give anyone your e-mail address. It is automatically provided if you choose a Software Coder (or you are the Software Coder chosen for) a project, and before that time you can use the message board to communicate. This does not only apply to e-mail addresses, but to all methods of communication, including phone, ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, etc... See \"Avoiding Commissions\" below for the reason.

PROVIDING CONTACT INFORMATION

You are prohibited from making direct contact with another member, unless it\'s for a project you (a Software Coder) have been picked for, or you (a Software Buyer) have picked a Software Coder for. This includes giving out your e-mail address, ICQ number, phone number, or any other method of contact outside of this site. Task Sonic provides you with message boards, which should be sufficient for pre-project planning.

AVOIDING COMMISSIONS

You are strictly prohibited from attempting to negotiate the fee for a project with another member directly (outside of Task Sonic ) after that project has been created/opened and before that project has been closed (basically, during an ongoing project). But this also applies to any project that was closed without a Software Coder being chosen, and then contacting them about the project anyway. Both parties are responsible for notifying Task Sonic if the payment amount increases (above the bid amount) after the project is closed. Receiving a larger amount than the original project bid, without notifying us, will be considered an attempt to avoid the commissions. When a Software Coder requests a withdraw, we always review all payments received for each project to verify that they match the bid. If at the time of a withdraw request the Software Coder has failed to notify Task Sonic staff of a payment received above the amount of his bid (a total payment above US$100), Task Sonic reserves the right to deduct double the fee for the amount that should have been reported. We believe our commissions are very fair and justified for the service we provide, therefore we will absolutely not tolerate any of this activity on Task Sonic .
