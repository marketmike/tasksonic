<br><strong>Dear Task Sonic Tasker,</strong><br> <br>While we can not tell you the amount of the bid, <strong><?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['bidder_name']; ?>
</strong> has just outbid you on the Tasksonic.com task named <strong><?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['link']; ?>
</strong>. To update your bid, visit the details page for <strong><?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['link']; ?>
</strong> and update your bid. <br><br>We recommend comparing your bid to the average bid before considering changing your bid. Task Owners should base their decisions on a well rounded set of information including the bid amount, a Taskers rating, verification standings, and the number of successful tasks performed on Task Sonic.<br><br>Good Luck !<br> <br>
